   This is the index page to my documentation for learning the fundamentals of machine learning.


Abstract
=========
This collection of projects and documentation serve as an archive to my progressive education into
the Fundamentals of Machine Learning. Content will be referenced from the course `Machine Learning Course for Beginners <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWONeJKn6kc>`_
from the `Free Code Camp Institute <https://www.freecodecamp.org>`_.

**Introduction to Machine Learning**
=====================================
Here, the contents of my application to the course material will be listed below.
Some pages will possibly have submodules, as well as projects referenced. The source
