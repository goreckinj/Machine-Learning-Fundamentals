# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals
This repository will serve as an archive in my progressive education about machine learning and its core fundamentals. This will include projects, notes and documentation on what was accomplished.

## Getting Started
To view contents of this repository, your first step is to clone the project and build the documentation located in root/docs. This is done using Sphinx with ReStructuredText.
